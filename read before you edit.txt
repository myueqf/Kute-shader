Hey there! Before you start editing this shader, make sure to check out the license first ^-^

This file tells you how the shader is put together~

The "program" folder holds files used by all three Minecraft worlds.
The folders world-1, world0, and world1 just include their matching program files.
They also have a special line #define DIMENSION_whatever so you can do stuff only in certain worlds â€” like if you want something only in the overworld, just check if DIMENSION_OVERWORLD is there :3

Most lighting happens in gbuffers inside the "/global/lighting" files.
Composite passes take care of things like post-processing effects, sky, fog, and clouds. You can peek inside those files to see what each pass does ^-^

About the buffers:
Right now, Kute uses 3 main buffers:

colortex0: main buffer

colortex1: bloom effects

colortex2: SMAA main

colortex3: SMAA area

gaux1: Reflections & TAA

colortex5: SMAA search
